<h1>Devil Project</h1>

----
Devil is a set of open, unencumbered Rusted Warfare mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license. The intention is to let 
everyone mod Rusted Warfare freely and openly, while also being able to innovate and process the mappings as they see fit.
